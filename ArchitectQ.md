### Third Party integration system.

1. I am a service/Platform provider for Clients(Buyer/Suppliers), and my SaaS is known as AMN.
2. I have enterprize Clients(Buyer/Suppliers), who deal with different enterprize services internally like SalesForce, ERP, SAP.
3. AMN provides Clients(Buyer/Suppliers) way to create RFQ/Order/Proposal/Production/Shipments.
4. Clients(Buyers/Suppliers) have a need for making sure their internal entierprize services are updated with the RFQ/Order/Proposal/Production/Shipments to manage their internal resources
5. There is also requirement from Clients(Buyers/Suppliers) to Approve certain actions in Thirdparty system before we proceed orders in AMN like Approving Order in SAP or ERP before we accept proposal or Submit Order to Supplier.
